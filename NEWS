
v0.6 (10-06-21)
----------------
- New function: 
 -> anchorReg: Performs anchor regression 

 - Changes in doQC: 
   -> Criterion for checking betadistr changed (threshold=0.1/0.5 for each type).
   -> In control metric plots: Also show failed controls which has NA on one of the axes.

v0.5 (02-06-21)
----------------
